Lost in translation

This project is for the second assignment at Experis Academy. It is an online sign language translator. It is a single page applicartion deployed on vercel and built with react js.

It contains a startup page, a translation page and a profile page. The user must first sign up on the startup page and will then be created in the database hosted on glich. After the user has been saved they can enter a word or sentance (up to 80 characters) which will then be translated and displayed in a box area under the input. On the users profile page the last up to ten translations they have entered are displayed in a list.
